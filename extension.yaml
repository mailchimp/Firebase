      Required Fields:

      1) `memberTags` - The Firestore document fields(s) to retrieve data from and classify as subscriber tags in Mailchimp. Acceptable data types include:
      
      - Array\<String\> - The extension will lookup the values in the provided fields and update the subscriber's member tags with the respective data values.


      - String - The extension will lookup the value in the provided field and update the subscriber's member tags with the provided value.


      2) `subscriberEmail` - The Firestore document field capturing the user email as is recognized by Mailchimp

      ```
      {
        "memberTags": ["domainKnowledge", "jobTitle"],
        "subscriberEmail": "emailAddress"
